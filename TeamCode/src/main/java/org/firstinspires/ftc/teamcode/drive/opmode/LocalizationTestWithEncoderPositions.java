/**
 * This is a simple teleop routine for testing localization. Drive the robot around like a normal
 * teleop routine and make sure the robot's estimated pose matches the robot's actual pose (slight
 * errors are not out of the ordinary, especially with sudden drive motions). The goal of this
 * exercise is to ascertain whether the localizer has been configured properly (note: the pure
 * encoder localizer heading may be significantly off if the track width has not been tuned).

        // When tuning the 3 dead wheels we noticed that even though we were trying to keep the bot
        // moving in only 1 axes, we where showing movement in the other axes. So when x should be
        // the only dimension changing, we saw y changing a little too. Over 100" of x, we might see
        // 2-3" of y. This does not seem right since there was no visible physical movement of the
        // robot in y. So we need to see the raw dead wheel encoder values to help debug this.
